    <p>
        In the previous Chapter we presented a high level introduction to some basic concepts in SymmetricDS, some of the
        high-level features, and a tutorial demonstrating a basic, working example of SymmetricDS in action. This chapter
        will focus on the key considerations and decisions one must make when planning a SymmetricDS implementation. As
        needed, basic concepts will be reviewed or introduced throughout this Chapter. By the end of the chapter you should
        be able to proceed forward and implement your planned design. This Chapter will intentionally avoid discussing the
        underlying database tables that capture the configuration resulting from your analysis and design process.
        Implementation of your design, along with discussion of the tables backing each concept, is covered in
        <a href="configuration.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Configuration">Chapter&nbsp;4, <i xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Configuration</i></a>
        .
    </p>
    <p> When needed, we will rely on an example of a typical use of SymmetricDS in retail situations. This example retail
        deployment of SymmetricDS might include many point-of-sale workstations located at stores that may have intermittent
        network connection to a central location. These workstations might have point-sale-software that uses a local
        relational database. The database is populated with items, prices and tax information from a centralized database.
        The point-of-sale software looks up item information from the local database and also saves sale information to the
        same database. The persisted sales need to be propagated back to the centralized database.
    </p>
    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="identifying-nodes"></a>3.1.&nbsp;Identifying Nodes</h2></div></div></div>
        
        <p>
            A
            <span class="emphasis"><em>node</em></span>
            is a single instance of SymmetricDS. It can be thought of as a proxy for a database which manages the
            synchronization of data to and/or from its database. For our example retail application, the following would be
            SymmetricDS nodes:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>Each point-of-sale workstation.</li><li>The central office database server.</li></ul></div><p>
            Each node of SymmetricDS can be either embedded in another application, run stand-alone, or even run in the
            background as a service. If desired, nodes can be clustered to help disperse load if they send and/or receive
            large volumes of data to or from a large number of nodes.
        </p>
        <p> Individual nodes are easy to identify when planning your implementation. If a database exists in your domain
            that needs to send or receive data, there needs to be a corresponding SymmetricDS instance (a node) responsible
            for managing the synchronization for that database.
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="organizing-nodes"></a>3.2.&nbsp;Organizing Nodes</h2></div></div></div>
        
        <p> Nodes in SymmetricDS are organized into an overall node network, with connections based on what data needs to
            be synchronized where. The exact organization of your nodes will be very specific to your synchronization goals.
            As a starting point, lay out your nodes in diagram form and draw connections between nodes to represent cases in
            which data is to flow in some manner. Think in terms of what data is needed at which node, what data is in common
            to more than one node, etc. If it is helpful, you could also show data flow into and out of external systems. As
            you will discover later, SymmetricDS can publish data changes from a node as well using JMS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our retail example, as shown in
            <a href="planning.html#figure-two-tier" title="Figure&nbsp;3.1.&nbsp;Two-Tier Retail Store Deployment Example">Figure&nbsp;3.1</a>
            , represents a tree hierarchy with a single central office node connected by lines to one or more children nodes
            (the POS workstations). Information flows from the central office node to an individual register and vice versa,
            but never flows between registers.
        </p>
        <p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="figure-two-tier"></a><div class="figure-contents">

        </p>
        <p>
            More complex organization can also be used. Consider, for example, if the same retail example is expanded to
            include store
            <span class="emphasis"><em>servers</em></span>
            in each store to perform tasks such as opening the store for the day, reconciling registers, assigning employees,
            etc. One approach to this new configuration would be to create a three-tier hierarchy (see
            <a href="planning.html#figure-three-tier-store-server" title="Figure&nbsp;3.2.&nbsp;Three-Tier, In-Store Server, Retail Store Deployment Example">Figure&nbsp;3.2</a>
            ). The highest tier, the centralized database, connects with each store server's database. The store servers, in
            turn, communicate with the individual point-of-sale workstations at the store. In this way data from each
            register could be accumulated at the store server, then sent on to the central office. Similarly, data from the
            central office can be staged in the store server and then sent on to each register, filtering the register's data
            based on which register it is.
        </p>
        <p>
            </p><div class="figure"><a name="figure-three-tier-store-server"></a><div class="figure-contents">
                
                <div class="mediaobject"><img src="./images/three-tier-arch.gif" alt="Three-Tier, In-Store Server, Retail Store Deployment Example"></div>

        <p>
            One final example, show in
            <a href="planning.html#figure-three-tier-regional" title="Figure&nbsp;3.3.&nbsp;Three-Tier, Regional Server, Retail Store Deployment Example">Figure&nbsp;3.3</a>
            , again extending our original two-tier retail use case, would be to organize stores by "region" in the world.
            This three tier architecture would introduce new regional servers (and corresponding regional databases) which
            would consolidate information specific to stores the regional server is responsible for. The tiers in this case
            are therefore the central office server, regional servers, and individual store registers.

        <p> These are just three common examples of how one might organize nodes in SymmetricDS. While the examples above
            were for the retail industry, the organization, they could apply to a variety of application domains.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="grouping-nodes"></a>3.3.&nbsp;Defining Node Groups</h2></div></div></div>
        
        <p>
            Once the organization of your SymmetricDS nodes has been chosen, you will need to
            <span class="emphasis"><em>group</em></span>
            your nodes based on which nodes share common functionality. This is accomplished in SymmetricDS through the
            concept of a
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Node Group</em></span>
            . Frequently, an individual tier in your network will represent one Node Group. Much of SymmetricDS'
            functionality is specified by Node Group and not an individual node. For example, when it comes time to decide
            where to route data captured by SymmetricDS, the routing is configured by
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Node Group</em></span>
            .
        </p>
        <p>
            For the examples above, we might define Node Groups of:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>"workstation", to represent each point-of-sale workstation</li><li>"corp" or "central-office" to represent the centralized node.</li><li>"store" to represent the store server that interacts with store workstations and sends and receives
                    data from a central office server.
                </li><li>"region" to represent the a regional server that interacts with store workstations and sends and
                    receives data from a central office server.
                </li></ul></div><p>
            Considerable thought should be given to how you define the Node Groups. Groups should be created for each set of
            nodes that synchronize common tables in a similar manner. Also, give your Node Groups meaningful names, as they
            will appear in many, many places in your implementation of SymmetricDS.
        </p>
        <p>Note that there are other mechanisms in SymmetricDS to route to individual nodes or smaller subsets of nodes
            within a Node Group, so do not choose Node Groups based on needing only subsets of data at specific nodes. For
            example, although you could, you would not want to create a Node Group for each store even though different tax
            rates need to be routed to each store. Each store needs to synchronize the same tables to the same groups, so
            'store' would be a good choice for a Node Group.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="linking-nodes"></a>3.4.&nbsp;Linking Nodes</h2></div></div></div>
        
        <p>
            Now that Node Groups have been chosen, the next step in planning is to document the individual links between Node
            Groups. These
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Node Group Links</em></span>
            establish a source Node Group, a target Node Group, and a
            <span class="emphasis"><em>data event action</em></span>
            , namely whether the data changes are
            <span class="emphasis"><em>pushed</em></span>
            or
            <span class="emphasis"><em>pulled</em></span>
            . The push method causes the source Node Group to connect to the target, while a pull method causes it to wait
            for the target to connect to it.
        </p>
        <p>For our retail store example, there are two Node Group Links defined. For the first link, the "store" Node
            Group pushes data to the "corp" central office Node Group. The second defines a "corp" to "store" link as a pull.
            Thus, the store nodes will periodically pull data from the central office, but when it comes time to send data to
            the central office a store node will do a push.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="choosing-channels"></a>3.5.&nbsp;Choosing Data Channels</h2></div></div></div>
        
        <p>When SymmetricDS captures data changes in the database, the changes are captured in the order in which they
            occur. In addition, that order is preserved when synchronizing the data to other nodes. Frequently, however, you
            will have cases where you have different "types" of data with differing priorities. Some data might, for example,
            need priority for synchronization despite the normal order of events. For example, in a retail environment, users
            may be waiting for inventory documents to update while a promotional sale event updates a large number of items.
        </p>
        <p>
            SymmetricDS supports this by allowing tables being synchronized to be grouped together into
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Channels</em></span>
            of data. A number of controls to the synchronization behavior of SymmetricDS are controlled at the Channel level.
            For example, Channels provide a processing order when synchronizing, a limit on the amount of data that will be
            batched together, and isolation from errors in other channels. By categorizing data into channels and assigning
            them to
            <a href="data-model.html#table_trigger" title="A.38.&nbsp;TRIGGER">TRIGGER</a>
            s, the user gains more control and visibility into the flow of data. In addition, SymmetricDS allows for
            synchronization to be enabled, suspended, or scheduled by Channels as well. The frequency of synchronization can
            also be controlled at the channel level.
        </p>
        
        <p> Choosing Channels is fairly straightforward and can be changed over time, if needed. Think about the differing
            "types" of data present in your application, the volume of data in the various types, etc. What data is
            considered must-have and can't be delayed due to a high volume load of another type of data? For example, you
            might place employee-related data, such as clocking in or out, on one channel, but sales transactions on another.
            We will define which tables belong to which channels in the next sections.
        </p>
        <div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3>
            <p> Be sure that, when defining Channels, all tables related by foreign keys are included in the same channel.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3>
            <p> Avoid deadlocks!  If client database transactions include tables that update common rows along with different rows, then
            concurrent synchronization can cause database deadlocks.  You can avoid this by using channels to segregate those tables
            that cause the deadlocks.
            </p>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="defining-data-changes"></a>3.6.&nbsp;Defining Data Changes to be Captured and Routed</h2></div></div></div>
        
        <p>
            At this point, you have designed the node-related aspects of your implementation, namely choosing nodes, grouping
            the nodes based on functionality, defining which node groups send and receive data to which others (and by what
            method). You have defined data Channels based on the types and priority of data being synchronized. The largest
            remaining task prior to starting your implementation is to define and document what data changes are to be
            captured (by defining SymmetricDS
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Triggers</em></span>
            ), to decide to which node(s) the data changes are to be
            <span class="emphasis"><em>routed</em></span>
            to, and to decide which trigger applies to which router and under what conditions. We will also, in this section, discuss the concept of an
            <span class="emphasis"><em>initial load</em></span>
            of data into a SymmetricDS node.
        </p>
        <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="defining-data-changes-triggers"></a>3.6.1.&nbsp;Defining Triggers</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>
                SymmetricDS uses
                <span class="emphasis"><em>database triggers</em></span>
                to capture and record changes to be synchronized to other nodes. Based on the configuration you provide,
                SymmetricDS creates the needed database triggers automatically for you. There is a great deal of flexibility
                in terms of defining the exact conditions under which a data change is captured. SymmetricDS triggers are
                defined in a table named
                <a href="data-model.html#table_trigger" title="A.38.&nbsp;TRIGGER">TRIGGER</a>
                . Each trigger you define is for a particular table associated. Each trigger can also specify:
                </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>whether to install a trigger for updates, inserts, and/or deletes</li><li>conditions on which an insert, update, and/or delete fires</li><li>a list of columns that should not be synchronized from this table</li><li>a SQL select statement that can be used to hold data needed for routing (known as External
                        Data)</li></ul></div><p>
            </p>
            <p> As you define your triggers, consider which data changes are relevant to your application and which ones
                ar not. Consider under what special conditions you might want to route data, as well. For our retail example,
                we likely want to have triggers defined for updating, inserting, and deleting pricing information in the
                central office so that the data can be routed down to the stores. Similarly, we need triggers on sales
                transaction tables such that sales information can be sent back to the central office.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="defining-data-changes-routers"></a>3.6.2.&nbsp;Defining Routers</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>
                The triggers that have been defined in the previous section only define
                <span class="emphasis"><em>when</em></span>
                data changes are to be captured for synchronization. They do not define
                <span class="emphasis"><em>where</em></span>
                the data changes are to be sent to. Routers, plus a mapping between Triggers and Routers (
                <a href="data-model.html#table_trigger_router" title="A.40.&nbsp;TRIGGER_ROUTER">TRIGGER_ROUTER</a>
                ), define the process for determining which nodes receive the data changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we discuss Routers and Trigger Routers, we should probably take a break and discuss the process
                SymmetricDS uses to keep track of the changes and routing. As we stated, SymmetricDS relies on auto-created
                database triggers to capture and record relevant data changes into a table, the
                <a href="data-model.html#table_data" title="A.3.&nbsp;DATA">DATA</a>
                table. After the data is captured, a background process chooses the nodes that the data will be synchronized
                to. This is called
                <span class="emphasis"><em>routing</em></span>
                and it is performed by the Routing Job. Note that the Routing Job does not actually send any data. It just
                organizes and records the decisions on where to send data in a "staging" table called
                <a href="data-model.html#table_data_event" title="A.4.&nbsp;DATA_EVENT">DATA_EVENT</a>
                and
                <a href="data-model.html#table_outgoing_batch" title="A.29.&nbsp;OUTGOING_BATCH">OUTGOING_BATCH</a>
                .
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we are ready to discuss Routers. The router itself is what defines the configuration of where to send a
                data change. Each Router you define can be associated with or assigned to any number of Triggers through a
                join table that defines the relationship. Routers are defined in the SymmetricDS table named
                <a href="data-model.html#table_router" title="A.33.&nbsp;ROUTER">ROUTER</a>
                . For each router you define, you will need to specify:
                </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>the target table on the destination node to route the data</li><li>the source node group and target node group for the nodes to route the data to</li><li>
                        a router
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>type</em></span>
                        and router
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>expression</em></span>
                    </li><li>whether to route updates, inserts, and/or deletes</li></ul></div><p>
            </p>
            <p>
                For now, do not worry about the specific routing types. They will be covered later. For your design simply
                make notes of the information needed and decisions to determine the list of nodes to route to. You will find
                later that there is incredible flexibility and functionality available in routers. For example, you will find
                you can:
                </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>send the changes to all nodes that belong to the target node group defined in the router.
                    </li><li>compare old or new column values to a constant value or the value of a node's identity.
                    </li><li>execute a SQL expression against the database to select nodes to route to. This SQL expression
                        can be passed values of old and new column values.
                    </li><li>execute a Bean Shell expression in order to select nodes to route to. The Bean Shell expression
                        can use the old and new column values.
                    </li><li>publish data changes directly to a messaging solution instead of transmitting changes to
                        registered nodes. (This router must be configured manually in XML as an extension point.)
                    </li></ul></div><p>
            </p>

             <p> For each of your Triggers (which specify when a data change should be captured),
                 you will need to decide which Router(s) to pair with the Trigger such that the change is routed
                 to the desired target nodes.   This needed mapping between Triggers and Routers, found in the table
                <a href="data-model.html#table_trigger_router" title="A.40.&nbsp;TRIGGER_ROUTER">TRIGGER_ROUTER</a>
                , defines configuration specific to a particular Trigger and Router combination that you need.
                In addition to defining which triggers map to which routers, the table also has several
                settings present to define various behaviors, including initial loads and ping back.

                <p>
                    SymmetricDS provides the ability to "load" or "seed" a node's database with specific sets of data from
                    its parent node. This concept is known as an
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>Initial Load</em></span>
                    of data and is used to start off most synchronization scenarios. The Trigger Router mapping defines how
                    initial loads can occur, so now is a good time to plan how your
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>Initial Loads</em></span>
                    will work. Using our retail example, consider a new store being opened. Initially, you would like to
                    pre-populate a store database with all the item, pricing, and tax data for that specific store. This is
                    achieved through an initial load. As part of your planning, be sure to consider which tables, if any, will
                    need to be loaded initially. SymmetricDS can also perform an initial load on a table with just a subset
                    of data. Initial Loads are further discussed in
                    <a href="configuration.html#configuration-initial-load" title="4.6.3.2.&nbsp;Initial Loads">Section&nbsp;4.6.3.2, &#8220;Initial Loads&#8221;</a>.

                <p>
                    When routing data, SymmetricDS by default checks each data change and will not route a data change back
                    to a node if it originated the change to begin with. This prevents the possibility of data changes
                    resulting in an infinite loop of changes under certain circumstances. You may find that, for some reason,
                    you need SymmetricDS to go ahead and send the data back to the originating node - a "ping back". As part
                    of the planning process, consider whether you have a special case for needing ping back. Ping Back
                    control is further discussed in
                    <a href="configuration.html#configuration-trigger-router-ping-back" title="4.6.3.4.&nbsp;Enabling &#34;Ping Back&#34;">Section&nbsp;4.6.3.4, &#8220;Enabling "Ping Back"&#8221;</a>.

            <p>
                Our final step in planning an implementation of SymmetricDS involves deciding how a new node is connected to,
                or
                <span class="emphasis"><em>registered</em></span>
                with a parent node for the first time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following are some options on ways you might register nodes:
                </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>The tutorial uses the command line utility to register each individual node.</li><li>A JMX interface provides the same interface that the command line utility does. JMX can be
                        invoked programmatically or via a web console.</li><li>Both the utility and the JMX method register a node by inserting into two tables. A script can
                        be written to directly register nodes by directly inserting into the database.</li><li>SymmetricDS can be configured to auto register nodes. This means that any node that asks for a
                        registration will be given one.</li></ul></div><p>
            </p>

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="defining-transformation"></a>3.7.&nbsp;Planning Data Transformations</h2></div></div></div>
        
        <p>
            SymmetricDS also provides the ability to
            <span class="emphasis"><em>transform</em></span>
            synchronized data instead of simply synchronizing it. Your application might, for example require a particular
            column in your source data to be mapped to two different target tables with possibly different column names. Or,
            you might need to "merge" one or more columns of data from two indepdentent tables into one table on the target.
            Or, you may want to set default column values on a target table based on a particular event on the source
            database. All of these operations, and many more, can be accomplished using SymmetricDS' transformation
            capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you plan your SymmetricDS implementation, make notes of cases where a data transformation is needed. Include
            details such as when the transformation might occur (is it only on an insert, or a delete?), which tables or
            columns play a part, etc. Complete details of all the transformation features, including how to configure a
            transformation, are discussed in <a href="configuration.html#transform-data" title="4.8.&nbsp;Transforming Data">Section&nbsp;4.8, &#8220;Transforming Data&#8221;</a>.

    <div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="defining-conflicts"></a>3.8.&nbsp;Planning Conflict Detection and Resolution</h2></div></div></div>
        
        <p> As a final step to planning an implementation, consider for a moment cases in which the same data may be
            modified at nearly the same time at more than one node. For example, can data representing a customer be modified
            at both a central office and a store location? Conflict detection is the act of determining if an insert, update
            or delete is in "conflict" due to the target data row not being consistent with the data at the source prior to
            the insert/update/delete. Conflict resolution is the act of figuring out what to do when a conflict is detected.
            Both detection and resolution behaviour can be configured and customized in a number of ways. For example, a
            conflict can be "detected" based solely on a single column which has been modified to a different value, or a row
            can be considered in conflict if any data in the row has been changed from what was expected, even if the column
            that has been changed was still expected. There are also numerous ways to resolve the conflict, such as
            referencing a timestamp column and choosing whichever edit was "most recent" or perhaps causing the conflict to
            cause the channel to go into error until a manual resolution takes place. A set of conflict detection /
            resolution rules is configured for a given node group link, but you can set the rules to be for a given channel
            or for a given table in a channel.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the purpose of planning your implementation, make a list of all tables that could have data being modified at
            more than one node at the same time. For each table, think through what should happen in each case if such an
            event occurs. If the tables on a given channel all have the same set of conflict resolution and detection rules,
            then you might be able to configure the rules for the channel instead of a series of table-level detections and
            resolutions. Complete details on how to configure conflict resolution and detection are discussed further in
